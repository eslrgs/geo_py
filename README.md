Open '1_basics.ipynb' to begin notebook

## Run on your own machine

Initial set-up (envname, kernelname, modulename = the name you want to use)

1) Download Anaconda for Python 3.7 from here:

            https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

2) Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)

3) Create environment (might take 5 – 10 mins):

            conda create --name envname python=3.7 anaconda  

4) Activate environment (should take < 10 s):

            conda activate envname

5) Create kernel (should take < 10 s):

            python -m ipykernel install --user --name kernelname

6) Install modules not in anaconda (option for future, might take time depending on size of module):

            pip install modulename

7) Navigate to the working directory/folder you downloaded all of the files in this repository to (different syntax for Windows and Mac, Google ‘terminal navigation commands’ for help):

            cd Desktop/geo_py

8) Open Jupyter Notebook in folder you’ve navigated to (should take < 10 s):

            jupyter notebook


Working set-up

1) Open Anaconda prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)

2) Activate environment (should take < 10 s):

            conda activate envname

3) Navigate to working directory/folder (different syntax for Windows and Mac, Google ‘terminal navigation commands’ for help):

            cd Desktop/geo_py

4) Open Jupyter Notebook (should take < 10 s):

            jupyter notebook

5) Internet browser should open Jupyter Notebook, if it doesn’t open Anaconda Prompt or Terminal will provide a link to copy and paste in the browser
